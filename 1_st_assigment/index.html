        <hr />
        <p>
          I am very foodie. I love to eat and cook. The food gives us energy.
          Without food, there is no life. There are so many dishes available in
          today’s world some like Indian foods like Biryani, Dosa, Pav Bhaji,
          Pani Puri etc whereas some like western foods like Pizza, Burger,
          Noodles etc. Among the number of food Pizza is my favorite food
          because it tastes and smells fabulous. The pizza itself looks so
          yummy, crispy and so cheesy. There is no better feeling in the world
          than a warm pizza box on your lap. My love for Pizza is very high. I
          am always hungry for pizza, be it any time of the day. Cheese is the
          secret ingredient of any food it makes any food taste yummy. Nearly
          any ingredient can be put on pizza. Those diced vegetables, jalapenos,
          tomato sauce, cheese and mushrooms makes me eat more and more like a
          unique work of art. Every pie is a different shape and size. There are
          thin crust pies, deep dish pies, and everything in between. There are
          pies with different cheeses and tomato sauce, or even pies with a
          completely different base altogether. On every occasion, I celebrate
          it with pizza style. There are times when I get scolded for having
          pizza all the time because anything in excess causes harms to our
          health but a pizza lover will always be a pizza lover. There is
          something between me and pizza the bond which cannot be broken.

		<li><h3> My Favorite Food (Falooda)</h3></li>
		<hr>
<p>The sweet drink was believed to have evolved from the Persian Faloodeh and is now available all over India.

	It was once reserved for the upper class during the Mughal era but it became a household name and favourite among dessert lovers.
	
	The popularity of the dessert in India have seen it enjoyed all over the world and numerous flavours being created.
	
	While there are many twists, the foundations remain the same. Milk, ice cream, sev and chia seeds all bring something different to falooda, whether it be taste or texture.
	
	
	A wide variety of syrups will create a unique tasting experience no matter which one you use to make falooda.
	
	As well as the delicious flavour, it even looks appealing especially with the layered effects of each ingredient.
	
	While the preparation can take time, it will be worth it. These recipes will help ensure that you can enjoy a cooling falooda, whatever the flavour.</p>

		<li><h3>My Favourite Food (ROS MALAI)</h3></li> <hr>
		<p>Ras malai is believed to have originated somewhere in Eastern Indian subcontinent, specifically in the Bengal region.[5] The Sen brothers of Comilla operating under the Matri Bhandar brand claim to be the original maker of the dessert. On the other hand, K.C. Das Grandsons also claims that it was invented by K.C. Das in Kolkata.[6][7] Bangladesh has begun the process of registering geographical indication status for Comillar ras malai.[8][9]

			According to The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink published by Oxford University Press "The term comes from Hindi raś 'juice', and malai 'cream'.</p>
